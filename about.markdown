**Hey there! I'm Pooja.** 

I am a ML Researcher with decent interest in engineering software products. As of 2020, I'm trying to be a better person in all walks of life. As a first step, I've started trying out everything that I always wanted to do, of which writting is one that I have been thinking about for quite a while now and hopefully this blog could be a positive effort to enhance my writting skills; perhaps one day I'll have poems under my name :D 


P.S Feel free to reach out to my gmail at any case. 


>Love,

>Pooja Solaikannu
