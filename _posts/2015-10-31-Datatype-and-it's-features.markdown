Hi Everyone, welcome to yet another ML post. Recently I was unlearing about ML strategies and I thought this could be worth sharing.

As we all know and agree, ML problem is driven by data in various forms. Generic types of data that can come in Tabular form are "Numeric", "Categorical", "Date and Time", "Geo/Location". One of the interesting and chanllenging component in ML Pipeline is that based on the problem type, we have to extract features of the the data provided to us. 

In this post we'll explore the ways to extarct useful data for Datatypes Date&Time and Geo/Location.

I hope the context of the post is clear now and let's gets started.

### Date and Time

### Geo/Location
