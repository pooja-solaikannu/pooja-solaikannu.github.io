Why do we need this blog?
For an ML researcher, the most desirable skill to have is storytelling with good visualizations. Even when we do the most amazing work with all the fantastic techniques available for ML/DL, all might go in vain if we can't convey the findings in the most simplest way possible.

So, This article is about a possible solution for understanding cosine similarity as simple as way.

>Note - This post does not talk about intricate details of cosine similarity's working. In case if you are here for it, please feel free to check out this link - [Cosine similarity - Understanding the Math]('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity')

What is mean by cosine similarity?
Cosine similarity is a metric used to measure how similar the documents are irrespective of their size. Mathematically, it measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors projected in a multi-dimensional space. The smaller the angle, higher the cosine similarity.
